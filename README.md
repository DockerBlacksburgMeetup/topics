# Meetup Topics

This repo is basically a placeholder to talk about topics.  If you have an idea or suggestion, post an issue for it in the issue tracker.  Few guidelines...

- **Search for matches first** - before posting a new idea, see if a request already exists for it.  It'll help keep the issue queue easier to manage
- **Plus one using responses** - GitHub has the ability to post emoji responses.  If you like a topic, simply post a response to the original topic, rather than making a new "+1" comment.  This will allow for better communication in the issue thread.
- **Post anything** - there's no bad suggestion or idea.  Even if you think it might be too specific, post it.  Even if a topic doesn't get a full night, maybe it can be combined with other ideas.
